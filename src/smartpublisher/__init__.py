SmartPublisher - Framework for building CLI/API applications with SmartSwitch.

Key classes:
- PublishedClass: Mixin for user apps (inherit from this)
- Publisher: Central coordinator (ONE instance per system)

Architecture:
- User apps inherit from PublishedClass
- Each app has its own root Switcher
- Publisher coordinates multiple apps and channels
- Channels (CLI, HTTP) expose apps via different transports
