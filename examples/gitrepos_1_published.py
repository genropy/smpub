GitRepos Tutorial - Step 1: Published Version

This demonstrates that smartpublisher works EVEN WITH STUB METHODS!

The Repository class from gitrepos_1_repo_base.py has methods with 'pass',
but we can still publish it and get:
- CLI interface (automatic!)
- HTTP API (automatic!)
- OpenAPI/Swagger docs (automatic!)

The LoggingPlugin will show every method call.

Usage:
    # CLI mode
    python gitrepos_1_published.py repo get-branches
    python gitrepos_1_published.py repo get-commits --limit 5
    python gitrepos_1_published.py repo get-info

    # HTTP mode (no args = start server)
    python gitrepos_1_published.py
    # Then open: http://localhost:8000/docs

Key Learning:
    You can develop with stubs/mocks and still have working CLI/HTTP!
    This is great for:
    - TDD (Test-Driven Development)
    - API-first design
    - Prototyping
    - Team collaboration (backend/frontend can work in parallel)
